# Loan Default Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze factors influencing loan default using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The insights gained from the analysis will help in making decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, or lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants.

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about past loan applicants and their loan status, including whether they defaulted or not. It includes variables such as loan amount, interest rate, annual income, and more.

## Analysis Approach
1. **Data Loading and Understanding**: Initial examination of the dataset.
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Analysis of individual variables.
3. **Bivariate Analysis**: Analysis of relationships between pairs of variables.
4. **Multivariate Analysis**: Analysis of interactions between multiple variables.
5. **Insights and Observations**: Key findings and recommendations.

## Key Findings
- **Loan Amount**: Higher loan amounts are associated with a higher likelihood of default.
- **Interest Rate**: Higher interest rates are associated with a higher likelihood of default.
- **Annual Income**: Lower annual incomes are associated with a higher likelihood of default.

## Recommendations
- Refine loan approval criteria based on identified risk factors.
- Consider offering lower amounts or higher interest rates to risky applicants.
